      <p> My name is Rose Ynohuye and I am excited to start my coding journey. I am currently working for a (not-so-much of a) startup (anymore) company in the veterinarian space.
      </p>
      <p>
      My goal by the end of this year is to have a good understanding of how websites are built and designed as well as becoming a leading expert in Veterinary websites. I aim to learn what future clients look for in their animal doctor websites and what veterinarians would like to see for their businesses, in addition to researching trends on all of the logical aspects of selling and maintaining websites in this space.
